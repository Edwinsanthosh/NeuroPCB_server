## 🧠 NeuroPCB-AI — Intelligent PCB Fault Detection & Self-Healing System

### 🚀 Overview

**NeuroPCB-AI** is an innovative system that connects hardware (ESP32-based simulated PCB) with an intelligent web/mobile application.
It detects PCB faults, monitors temperature and voltage in real time, and even uses an AI model to suggest solutions — all while sending alerts through BLE/Wi-Fi.

---

### 🌟 Key Features

* 🔌 **Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Connectivity** — Syncs with the PCB hardware for live data updates.
* ⚙️ **Real-Time Fault Detection** — Detects short circuits, overheating, and voltage anomalies.
* 📈 **Live Monitoring Dashboard** — Displays sensor readings, health status, and fault heatmaps.
* 🤖 **AI Advisor** — Suggests repair actions based on fault type and behavior.
* 🔔 **Smart Alerts** — Notifies users instantly when faults are detected or resolved.
* 🧰 **Temperature Monitoring** — Continuously tracks part temperature to prevent damage.
* 🧪 **Simulated Hardware Testing** — Fully testable via **Wokwi** (ESP32 simulator).

### ⚙️ How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NeuroPCB-AI.git

# 2️⃣ Enter the project folder
cd NeuroPCB-AI

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

# 4️⃣ Run locally
npm start
```

Frontend will be available at → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

### ☁️ Deployment

* **Frontend:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com) → auto-deploys on every Git push
* **Backend:** [Render](https://render.com) → `https://neuropcb-server.onrender.com`

---

### 🔗 API Endpoints

| Endpoint           | Description                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `/api/status`      | Returns current hardware status  |
| `/api/faults`      | Sends detected faults            |
| `/api/suggestions` | Returns AI-generated repair tips |

---

### 📱 Mobile Integration

The same React codebase can be converted into a mobile app using **Expo**:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
expo start
```

Then scan the QR code using **Expo Go** app to test it on your mobile.

---

### 🧠 AI Module

The AI model runs lightweight fault prediction using TensorFlow Lite.
It provides possible causes and recommendations like:

> “Voltage spike detected at Node 3 — check capacitor C2 for leakage.”

---

### ⚡ Hardware Simulation

Use [Wokwi ESP32 Simulator](https://wokwi.com) and connect your Render backend:

```cpp
const char* server = "https://neuropcb-server.onrender.com";
```

This allows real-time sensor data transmission to your app.

---

### 🔒 Future Enhancements

* PCB 3D Visualization in the dashboard
* Predictive maintenance using historical data
* Integration with real hardware prototype
* Voice-based assistant for fault handling

Would you like me to make it more **GitHub portfolio-optimized** (with shields, emojis, and badges like `🧠 AI`, `⚡ IoT`, `🚀 React`)?
That version looks great for freelancing and LinkedIn portfolio sharing.
